ASSIGNMENT TITLE
================
Mini Project: SmartTrade – Real-Time Trading System Using Advanced C#


COURSE CONTEXT
==============
Course          : Advanced C# Programming
Module          : Generics, Nullable Types, Extension Methods, Pattern Matching
Difficulty      : Intermediate → Advanced
Assignment Type : Individual Mini Project


PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================
A brokerage firm wants to build a lightweight, console-based trading system for internal testing and learning purposes.

The system must:
- Simulate equity trading
- Handle market price fluctuations safely
- Calculate trade value and brokerage
- Maintain global trade analytics

The solution must use advanced C# features with clean architecture, type safety, and good performance.


OBJECTIVES
==========
After completing this assignment, the student should be able to:
- Apply advanced C# language features in a real-world domain
- Design extensible and maintainable systems
- Demonstrate understanding of generics, nullable types, and extension methods
- Implement clean object-oriented design


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================
The system must:
- Support equity trades
- Handle missing market prices safely
- Store trades generically
- Track total trades at system level
- Apply brokerage and tax calculations
- Process trades dynamically


TASKS TO BE PERFORMED (VERY SPECIFIC)
====================================

TASK 1: Market Price Snapshot Using Struct
------------------------------------------
Requirements:
- Create ONE struct named `PriceSnapshot`
- The struct MUST contain:
  - Stock Symbol
  - Stock Price
- The struct MUST be used only for temporary market data

Expected Implementation Proof:
- Create at least one `PriceSnapshot` instance
- Display symbol and price


TASK 2: Base Trade Abstraction
------------------------------
Requirements:
- Create ONE abstract class named `Trade`
- The class MUST contain:
  - Trade ID
  - Stock Symbol
  - Quantity
- Declare ONE abstract method:
  - Calculate trade value
- Override `ToString()` from `System.Object`

Expected Implementation Proof:
- Display trade details using `ToString()`


TASK 3: Equity Trade Implementation
-----------------------------------
Requirements:
- Create ONE concrete class named `EquityTrade`
- The class MUST:
  - Inherit from `Trade`
  - Add ONE nullable property: Market Price
  - Implement trade value calculation using the null-coalescing operator

Expected Implementation Proof:
- Calculate trade value when:
  - Market price is present
  - Market price is missing (`null`)


TASK 4: Generic Trade Repository
--------------------------------
Requirements:
- Create ONE generic class named `TradeRepository<T>`
- Apply a generic constraint so that ONLY `Trade` types are allowed
- The repository MUST:
  - Store multiple trades
  - Add new trades
  - Increment a global counter whenever a trade is added

Expected Implementation Proof:
- Add at least two trades
- Display repository contents


TASK 5: Static Trade Analytics
------------------------------
Requirements:
- Create ONE static class named `TradeAnalytics`
- The class MUST contain:
  - A static variable to track total trades
  - A static method to display analytics

Expected Implementation Proof:
- Display the total number of trades executed


TASK 6: Extension Methods for Financial Calculations
----------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
- Create ONE static class for extension methods
- Add:
  - Brokerage calculation method
  - Tax (GST) calculation method
- These methods MUST:
  - Extend numeric types
  - NOT modify the `Trade` class

Expected Implementation Proof:
- Apply brokerage and tax on trade value


TASK 7: Pattern Matching for Trade Processing
---------------------------------------------
Requirements:
- Create ONE trade processing method
- Use pattern matching to:
  - Identify `EquityTrade`
  - Execute appropriate logic

Expected Implementation Proof:
- Display trade type during processing


TASK 8: Boxing and Unboxing
---------------------------
Requirements:
- Store total trade count in an `object` type
- Retrieve it back into a value type

Expected Implementation Proof:
- Print boxed and unboxed values


TASK 9: Main Program Flow
-------------------------
Requirements:
- Create a repository instance
- Create at least two `EquityTrade` objects
- Assign:
  - Trade ID
  - Symbol
  - Quantity
  - Market Price
- Add trades to the repository
- Process trades
- Display:
  - Trade details
  - Trade value
  - Brokerage
  - Tax
- Display global analytics


OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
===============================
The output MUST include:
- Trade processing message
- Trade details
- Calculated trade value
- Brokerage charges
- Tax amount
- Total trades executed


CONSTRAINTS
===========
- Do NOT use external libraries
- Do NOT skip any task
- Do NOT hardcode output values
- Follow object-oriented principles strictly


EVALUATION CRITERIA
===================
Correct use of advanced C# features : 40%
Clean design & structure             : 25%
Output correctness                   : 20%
Code readability                     : 15%


SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
=======================
- Complete source code
- Console output screenshots
- Brief explanation (1–2 lines) per task


BONUS (OPTIONAL)
================
- Add a new trade type
- Add risk validation logic
