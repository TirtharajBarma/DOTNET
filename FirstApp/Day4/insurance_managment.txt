INSURANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (OOP BASED)

--------------------------------------------------

Problem Statement:
Design and implement an Insurance Management System using C# and advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

--------------------------------------------------

Title:
Insurance Management System using Advanced OOP Concepts in C#

--------------------------------------------------

Objective:
To design and implement a console-based Insurance Management System in C# that demonstrates the use of the following advanced OOP concepts:

1. Sealed classes
2. Abstract base classes
3. Inheritance and method overriding
4. Method hiding using the `new` keyword
5. Init-only properties
6. Encapsulation with validation
7. Indexers
8. Runtime polymorphism

--------------------------------------------------

Problem Description:
You are required to build an Insurance Management System for an insurance company that manages different types of insurance policies.  
The system must follow real-world business rules and strict object-oriented design principles.

--------------------------------------------------

System Requirements:

PART 1: Security Module

1. Create a sealed class that handles user authentication.
2. This class must NOT be inherited.
3. It should display a confirmation message after successful authentication.

--------------------------------------------------

PART 2: Base Insurance Policy

1. Create an abstract base class named `InsurancePolicy`.
2. The class should contain:
   - An init-only property for Policy Number
   - A validated Premium property (Premium must be greater than zero)
   - A Policy Holder Name

3. Include the following methods:
   - A virtual method to calculate the premium
   - A method to display generic policy information

--------------------------------------------------

PART 3: Derived Insurance Types

A) Life Insurance

1. Inherit from `InsurancePolicy`.
2. Override the premium calculation method by adding a fixed life-insurance charge.
3. Demonstrate method hiding by redefining the policy display method using the `new` keyword.

B) Health Insurance

1. Inherit from `InsurancePolicy`.
2. Override the premium calculation method.
3. Seal the overridden method to prevent further modification.

--------------------------------------------------

PART 4: Policy Directory (Indexer Implementation)

1. Create a class that stores multiple insurance policies.
2. Use a `List` internally to store policy objects.
3. Implement indexers to:
   - Access policies by index
   - Access policies by policy holder name

--------------------------------------------------

PART 5: Main Program Execution

The main program should perform the following steps:

1. Authenticate the user.
2. Create Life Insurance and Health Insurance policy objects.
3. Store the policies in the policy directory.
4. Retrieve policy details using both indexers.
5. Demonstrate:
   - Runtime polymorphism using overridden methods
   - Method hiding using base-class and derived-class references

--------------------------------------------------

Expected Output:

User authenticated successfully

Amit
102
Life Premium: 5500
Health Premium: 8000
Life Insurance Policy
Insurance Policy

--------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Output:

1. Authentication Message  
   - Displayed by the sealed security class.

2. Indexer by Index  
   - Displays the policy holder name of the first policy (Amit).

3. Indexer by Name  
   - Displays the policy number of the policy holder named Neha.

4. Runtime Polymorphism  
   - Correct premium calculation based on the actual object type.

5. Method Hiding Demonstration  
   - Calling `ShowPolicy()` using a derived-class reference prints:
     Life Insurance Policy

   - Calling the same method using a base-class reference prints:
     Insurance Policy
